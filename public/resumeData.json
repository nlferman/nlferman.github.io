    "bio":"With over 4 years of experience working in AGILE environments to set up mobile apps and webpages on large and small teams, I come equipped with knowledge of how to get a project done in a timely manner. I am also a game making hobbyist using Unity. I have set up Augmented Reality applications using sockets to communicate between a server and mobile app, as well as designed 2D games using the Corgi engine and More Mountains Topdown engine. I have also done some multiplayer games using MLAPI. I have hosted WebGL games on Angular and placed them in a virtual environment using the Aframe library (built off of Three.js).",
